# Angular Migration Workspace

This workspace now contains a functional starter conversion of the PHP project:

- `frontend/` → Angular application with routes mapped from legacy PHP pages.
- `backend/` → Node/Express API with starter endpoints for products, cart, wishlist, auth, and checkout.

## Run plan

1. Install dependencies in both folders.
2. Start backend on port `3000`.
3. Start frontend and verify route-level migration.
